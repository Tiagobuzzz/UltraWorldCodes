# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution! Please follow these steps:

1. Create feature branches from `main` and keep commits focused.
2. Run `./run-tests.sh` before submitting any pull request.
3. Use `dotnet format` to automatically format your code.
4. New features should include unit tests when possible.
5. Open a pull request and request a code review from another maintainer.
6. Periodic code reviews are scheduled every month to keep code quality high.

For large changes, open an issue to discuss the design first.
